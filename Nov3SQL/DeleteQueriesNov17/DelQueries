//We have delete from track tables as well since tracks are part of an album and when album itself is not there then there won't be tracks as well. As per ER diagram, we did the right thing by deleting the albums from tables which have dependency on albumId. But we have to rely on intuition as well.

delete
from PlaylistTrackDup
where TrackId in
(select TrackId
from TrackDup where AlbumId=10)

delete
from InvoiceLineDup
where TrackId in
(select TrackId
from TrackDup where AlbumId=10)
