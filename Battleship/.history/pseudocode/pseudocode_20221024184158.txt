Ask the user what size of Grid he/she wants for himself or herself and also for the 
opponent.
create a multidimensional array
Initialize the outer grid
create an empty grid at each index of the outer grid
Now we have a grid having empty grids inside i.e. an array having empty arrays inside
Loop in such a way that we have access to each item within the inner array.
So we need to loop twice (for loop within for loop arr[i][j] = item)
Initialize what value we want this item to have.


Print header first
