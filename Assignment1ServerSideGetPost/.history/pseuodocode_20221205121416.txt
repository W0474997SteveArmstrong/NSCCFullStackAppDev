Step1

Create ui.html file

!

Step2 
give suitable title
add form tag within the body and have a button to add the customer data
leave action="" parameter of the form tag as empty or remove it all together.
The form must have first name, last name and email as the form elements along
with the button named Add

Step3

Create an empty div element which will allow us to perform DOM manipulation operations
We give a name to this empty div as customerList

-----In these 3 steps, our HTML portion is done.

Now on to our next focus area which is client side code
---------------------------------------------------------

When the user interacts with the UI and fills the details in the form,
upon clicking the add button, an event gets triggered and the client requests
the server on behalf of the user to get the requested resource back from the server
as a response.

Step1

our client will fetch data based on the provided url.
This url is the port on which our server is running and the end point or API
which the server is using to map itself to the database.


const url = "give the url"
use fetch and then keywords twice.
We get the body of the json.
